# Palindrome checker function

<p>
A <strong>palindrome</strong> is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. In other words, when the characters are reversed, the resulting sequence remains unchanged. Palindromes are not limited to specific languages or character sets and can be found in various contexts, including single words like "radar," phrases like "madam," and even numbers like "121." Additionally, palindromes can be more complex and include spaces, punctuation, and casing, as long as the sequence remains unchanged when read backward.
